Welcome to BinPy's documentation!
=================================

Contents:

It is a library which will serve as a base to develop circuit based applications and educational software on top of it. BinPy is a clear representaion of fundamentals. Everything has been written from scratch such as gates, logical operations, etc. This package does not depend on any external library other than pure Python.

We use GitHub for project management and collaborations.
Setting up development environment for BinPy is pretty easy. You just need to have Python installed on your computer.
